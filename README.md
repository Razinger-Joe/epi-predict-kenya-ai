## Why This Matters (Executive Summary)

**The Problem:** Currently, the healthcare response to disease outbreaks in Kenya is often **reactionary**. Hospitals and counties deal with outbreaks *after* they happen, leading to overwhelmed facilities, medication shortages, and preventable loss of life.

**The Pain Points:**
- 📉 **Delayed Data**: Paper records take weeks to aggregate.
- 🏥 **Overwhelmed Hospitals**: Sudden patient surges catch facilities off guard.
- 💊 **Supply Chain Gaps**: Pharmacies run out of critical meds during peak demand.

**The Solution:** EpiPredict Kenya AI flips the script from *reaction* to *prediction*. By analyzing patterns in real-time, we give decision-makers a **2-week head start** to mobilize resources, stock medicines, and warn communities.

---

## How It Works (Simplified)

We built this platform to be powerful yet easy to use on any device.

- **The Brain (AI Engine)**: Uses historical data and current trends to spot outbreaks before they spread.
- **The Vault (Supabase)**: A secure, cloud-based locker that keeps all patient and health data safe and private.
- **The Face (React & Mobile)**: A fast, app-like interface that works perfectly on low-cost smartphones and tablets used by field workers.
- **The Guard (Security)**: Advanced encryption ensures that only authorized health officials can see sensitive data.

| Token | Light Mode | Dark Mode | Purpose |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| `--primary` | Kenya Green | Kenya Green (brighter) | Primary actions |
| `--accent` | Medical Blue | Medical Blue | Secondary emphasis |
| `--destructive` | Kenya Red | Kenya Red | Alerts & warnings |

Custom CSS variables are defined in `src/index.css` with full dark mode support.
