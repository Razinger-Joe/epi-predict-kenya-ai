# Non-Technical Guide to EpiPredict Kenya AI

**For Hospital Administrators, County Health Officials, and Policy Makers**

---

## 1. What is EpiPredict Kenya AI?

EpiPredict is an early-warning system for diseases. Think of it like a weather forecast, but for outbreaks. Instead of telling you it *is* raining, it tells you it *is going to* rain in two weeks, giving you time to buy umbrellas.

**Goal:** To move Kenya's healthcare system from **reacting** to crises to **preventing** them.

## 2. Using the Dashboard

The dashboard is your command center. Here is how to read it:

### The "Risk Meter"
You will see cards showing **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** risk levels for different counties.
- 🟢 **Low**: Normal activity. Business as usual.
- 🟡 **Medium**: Slight increase in cases. Monitor closely.
- 🔴 **High**: Outbreak likely imminent. Mobilize resources immediately.

### The Map
The interactive map shows Kenya's 47 counties.
- Click on a county to see specific predictions for Malaria, Cholera, or Influenza.
- Red zones indicate areas that need immediate attention.

## 3. Security & Privacy (For Compliance Officers)

We know that health data is sensitive. We have built EpiPredict with "Privacy First" principles:

- **What we store**: We only store aggregated trend data (e.g., "50 cases of flu in Nairobi") rather than individual patient names.
- **How it's locked**: We use **Encryption** (like bank-grade security) to scramble data so hackers cannot read it.
- **Who can see it**: Only authorized personnel with a login can access the dashboard.
- **Compliance**: Our system is designed to adhere to Kenya's **Data Protection Act (2019)** regarding health data processing.

## 4. Mobile Access

You do not need a laptop to use this.
- **Works on Phones**: Open the link on any smartphone.
- **Installable**: You can "Add to Home Screen" to use it just like a regular app, even with spotty internet.

## 5. Contact & Support
